								<h3>How to Use The Course</h3>
								<p>The course player is designed with 3 main areas: the banner at the top, the main 
                                    content area and the navigation and a footer at the bottom of the player window. 
                                    The banner contains information about the course and the current location within 
                                    it (if the author has chosen to provide that information there) as well as a 
                                    menu to access additional player capabilities such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Help.</b> You're reading it now.</li>
                                    <li><b>Table of contents.</b> This will show you the overall course structure, allow you to go to a different part of the course and give you a sense of your overall progress.</li>
                                    <li><b>Resources (if available).</b> Provides a central location for links to additional resources found throughout the course that may enrich your learning on a particular subject.</li>
                                    <li><b>Change Language (if available).</b> Provides the ability to change the language version of the player and content if it has been localized to one or more languages.</li>
                                    <li><b>Change Tracks (if available).</b> Sometimes authors take long courses and organize them into smaller parts so that you can take the portions that are relevant to you. These are called tracks, and usually you choose them prior to starting to take the training. If they allow you to change your mind after you started, this is how you'd do it.</li>
                                    <li><b>Download (if available).</b> Downloads the course to the Access Point Offline Player</li>
                                    <li><b>Glossary (if available).</b> Provides definitions of terms found in the course.</li>

								<h3>Navigation using the keyboard</h3>
                                <p>All actionable items in the player or content pages should support receiving the focus and be part of the tab order. In addition, the player provides several keystroke combinations to allow users to navigate without the use of a mouse. The table below contains the list of supported keyboard shortcuts. Screen reader users may be required to instruct the screen reader to pass the keystrokes through to the browser to overcome any conflict with the screen reader keyboard shortcuts.</p>
                                <table>
                                <tr><th style="text-align:left;width:70%;padding-right:.5%;">Player Feature</th><th style="text-align:left;">Keyboard Shortcut</th></tr>

                                <tr><td>Turn on Accessible Mode for drag and drop </td><td>CTRL + ALT + A</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Send Focus to the Content Area </td><td>CTRL + ALT + K</td></tr>

                                <h3>Screen Reader Support</h3>
                                <p>The player has implemented a visually hidden area at the top of each content page to provide screen reader users hints regarding the content on the page and what is expected to complete the page. This visually hidden may also contain the relevant portions of the content from the page re-organized to eliminate the need to navigate around the page to activate visual elements. It also includes shortcut links to assist with navigation through the course. </p>
                                <h3>Text Sizing</h3>
                                <p>The player was implemented using an approach that will automatically resize the fonts as the browser window size increases. To increase font size, hit the F11 key to go full screen. To further increase font size you may also increase the browser zoom level (this may cause scroll bars to appear). </p>
                                <h3>Closed Captions and Transcripts</h3>
                                <p>All instances of audio and video are capable of providing either closed captions or a transcript (or both). Audio player captions are on automatically. Use the transcript button on the audio player to open a transcript window for page audio. Use the video player's closed caption or transcript button to use those capabilties when video is playing.</p>
                                <h3>Alternate Text for Images</h3>
                                <p>Content authors are responsible for providing alternate text for images used in the course. All images used as buttons by built-in course functions have alternate text to indicate their purpose. </p>

							<div class="help_topic_content">

								<p>Some courses require that you go through the course in a specific order. In order to accomplish this, authors can enable a linear navigation restriction to force users to go through the pages in order.</p>
                                <p>When linear navigation is in place, you need to complete each page entirely prior to moving forward.

                                <li><b>Video Pages</b>. These may be set to require you to watch the entire video, and may have the fast forward (scrubber bar) disabled. Watch the video to complete the page.</li>
                                <li><b>Content pages</b>. These pages take a variety of styles, but some require you to click a series of tiles, tabs or images on the screen to see, read or hear information. </li>

								<p>We try our best to give everyone a good playback experience for video, but it's not always easy. There are many factors that go into having a good experience with media (including having good media to start with). Assuming the video itself isn't choppy, you can try the following:

In your task tray (lower right of your screen), you should see a volume looking icon. Right click that, choose playback devices, and make sure the default device for playback is what you think it is. If it is, then close that window, left click on the same icon, and go to the Mixer. Look for the browser and make sure that the volume is turned up. </li>
                                <li><b>Your browser has audio turned off.</b> Back in the old internet days, web masters used to think it was cool to have audio play automatically when their page loaded. That was really annoying, so users would disable audio playing on web pages. Perhaps you were one of those people and forgot to enable it when taking training. Go to Internet Options in the browser, click on the advanced tab, and scroll way down until you see a "Multimedia" section. Make sure the "Enable sounds on web pages" option is checked. </li>

								<p >The course is designed scale up text and content as the browser gets bigger, so if you switch to full screen mode for the browser you can increase the size of everything. The easiest way to do that is:</p>

                                <li>Use the F11 key</li>
                                <li>Maximize the window the course is in (not quite full screen, but pretty close)</li>
                                <li>If your menu bar is visible for the browser window, use the View menu, choose Full screen</li>

							<div class="help_topic_content">
								<p>This can be a bit complicated. The player doesn't require plug-ins, unless of course it requires plug-ins, then you need them. The  player is designed to use as few plug-ins as possible to provide the greatest support across different Windows OS versions. In order to support things like being embedded in a Windows 8 application or played in the IE10 Modern browser, media playback is done through HTML5 video if possible. However, in order to support things like IE8 (which doesn't support HTML5 video tags), we need Silverlight to play media. Content authors also may have added content that requires other plugins (although in courses destined for Learning Central this is technically prohibited), and if they have added Silverlight or Flash content you'll need to have whatever they require.</p>
								<p>With that in mind, the basic information about what we require or have tested against is below.</p>
                                <h3>Video (and content in general)</h3>
								<p>For optimum viewing set screen resolution to 1024 by 768 or higher, zoom at 100% or lower.</p>

								<h3>Browsers and Other Software</h3>
                                We're Microsoft, so of course we'd like you to be using Microsoft® Internet Explorer. We encourage you to update to the latest IE version available for your OS. The browser must be configured to run Active X® controls and plug-ins. The full list of browser support is:

							<a href="#">What is Access Point?</a>
							<div class="help_topic_content">
								<p>Access Point Studio is an internal Microsoft course authoring tool that employees (or vendors) can use to build standards based online course content to deploy on Learning Central, the Partner Learning Center or other learning portals and web sites. Access Point is able to provide SCORM 1.2 conformant courseware (or courses that are deployed simply to a web-site, USB drive or other form) that contains a wide variety of content, including rich media, interactive pages and assessments.</p>
								<p>The tool is developed, maintained and supported by Sales, Marketing & Services Group - Readiness (SMSGR).</p>

						</div>
						<div class="help_topic">
							<a href="#">Can I use Access Point to build cool training?</a>
							<div class="help_topic_content">
								<p>Access Point is free to use for any internal MS FTE or vendor working on behalf of MS to build and deliver training to employees or partners. Deployment and hosting of the content may or may not be so free, depending on where you plan to host it and any arrangements you may have with them.</p>
                                <p> Access Point is the standard content authoring tool for deployments on Learning Central, so unless you have a really good reason not to use it, it's going to be your tool of choice for building and delivering content on that portal.</p>
